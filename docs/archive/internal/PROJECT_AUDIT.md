# PROJECT_AUDIT.md — LeadRTB
> **Audit Date:** 2026-02-26 | **Scope:** Full repository scan — all .md, source, contracts, CI, scripts  
> **Method:** Direct file content inspection against deployed on-chain state

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Overall Readiness: 8.5 / 10** — The core codebase is production-grade with real on-chain activity (7 verified contracts, 1,500+ total transactions on Base Sepolia). The primary risk is **documentation rot**: at least 3 root-level `.md` files contain wrong contract addresses from pre-redeployment, and 2 files (`context.md`, `gemini-report.md`) are superseded AI-generated dumps that add noise for judges. The tech stack, Chainlink integration, and demo flow are solid.

**Strengths:**
- 7 contracts deployed + source-verified on Base Sepolia (CONTRACTS.md is accurate)
- 6+ genuine Chainlink service integrations (CRE, Automation, VRF, Functions, Data Feeds, ACE)
- Real API-backed features: bounty pools, auto-bid engine, MCP agent with 12 tools
- CI pipeline (4-job matrix: lint, Jest, Hardhat, Artillery)
- Demo orchestrator with certified on-chain runs

**Critical Issues:**
- `submission-checklist.md` references **3 wrong contract addresses** from a prior deployment
- Documentation bloat: 10 root-level .md files + 7 in docs/ — several superseded or redundant
- Zero project-level tests in `tests/` directory (only Artillery load configs in `tests/load/`)

## 2. Prioritized Issue List

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix Before Submission)

| # | File | Issue | Action |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| C1 | `submission-checklist.md` | **3 wrong contract addresses** — CREVerifier listed as `0xe9c9...D6` (actual: `0xfec22...af8`), AuctionAutomation `0x853c...7B` (no such contract — should be PersonalEscrowVault `0x56bB...F8C`), VRF LeadVault `0xB4e3...8C2` (actual VRFTieBreaker: `0x86c8...930e`). A judge clicking these Basescan links would find **non-existent or unrelated contracts**. | **Update** all addresses to match `CONTRACTS.md` (source of truth) |
| C2 | `submission-checklist.md` | **Wrong contract names** — Section 2 says "AuctionAutomation" (doesn't exist; Automation lives in PersonalEscrowVault). Section 3 says "LeadVault" (doesn't exist; VRF is in VRFTieBreaker). | **Rewrite** sections 2 and 3 to use actual contract names |
| C3 | `submission-checklist.md` | Section 1 says `contracts/src/CREVerifier.sol` — the actual path is `contracts/contracts/CREVerifier.sol` | **Fix** path |

### 🟠 High (Should Fix)

| # | File | Issue | Action |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| H1 | `context.md` (23KB, 398 lines) | AI-generated "ground-truth context" dump from 2026-02-24. Superseded by `CONTRACTS.md`, `CHAINLINK_SERVICES_AUDIT.md`, and `current-status.md`. Contains outdated claims (e.g. "6 deployed contracts" — now 7, BountyMatcher was added). Adds noise for judges. | **Delete** or move to `docs/archive/` |
| H2 | `gemini-report.md` (7.7KB) | Prior AI audit report (rated 9.8/10). References deleted files (`docs/AB_TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/BETA_PLAYBOOK.md`). Some recommendations already implemented. Not useful for judges. | **Delete** or move to `docs/archive/` |
| H3 | `current-status.md` (26KB, 356 lines) | Massive internal status tracker. Contains **3 copies of the contract address table** (lines 16-28, 282-295, 343-355). Full of strikethrough completed items (~~H1~~, ~~M2~~, etc.) and "Do Right Now" action items. Reads like an internal working document, not a submission artifact. | **Archive** to `docs/archive/` — not judge-facing |
| H4 | `demo-results-db4763d9.json` | Certified demo artifact tracked in git at root level. Contains raw on-chain data. Should be in `docs/` or `docs/certified-runs/`. | **Move** to `docs/certified-runs/` |
| H5 | `npm-err.log` + `npm-full.log` | Log files committed to git (918 bytes each). | **Delete** and add `*.log` to `.gitignore` |
| H6 | `faucet-wallets.txt` | Contains 31+ private keys at project root. Currently gitignored (✅) but extremely high risk if accidentally staged. | **Move** off-disk or to a secure vault; confirm `.gitignore` coverage |
| H7 | README Mermaid diagram | Uses `-->|label|` arrow syntax which renders correctly on GitHub but may break in other Markdown renderers. Currently has 11 nodes — complex for a high-level overview. | **Review** for readability; consider simplifying |
| H8 | `current-status.md` line 36 says `submission-checklist.md` wrong addresses are "✅ Fixed" — but they are **still wrong** | **Fix** (this will be resolved when C1 is done) |

### 🟡 Medium

| # | File | Issue | Action |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| M1 | `PRIVACY_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md` (23KB, 272 lines) | Deep feasibility study for Confidential HTTP and Private Token Transfers integration. Well-written but very long. References "Days 1-5" implementation timeline that is now past. Not redundant with `CHAINLINK_SERVICES_AUDIT.md` (different scope — privacy feasibility vs service verification). | **Keep** but add a header note: "This is a Phase 2 feasibility study. Phase 1 (CRE Workflows) is complete." |
| M2 | `CHAINLINK_SERVICES_AUDIT.md` (64 lines) | Accurate and current. Lists all 10 Chainlink integration points with correct addresses. Well-structured. | **Keep** as-is |
| M3 | `ROADMAP.md` (148 lines) | Version string says "v0.9.2 (24 February 2026)". Phase 0 has unchecked items (Privacy Track, Agents Track, Data Streams, Video). Some may be completed since. | **Update** checked items to reflect current state |
| M4 | `final-submission-certification.md` | References demo run `05ad5f55` (5 cycles, $239) but README references `db4763d9` (7 cycles, $189). Confusing for judges. | **Consolidate** to one canonical run |
| M5 | `backend/src/services/analytics-mock.ts` | Mock analytics service — may be unused in production paths. | **Verify** usage; if unused, delete |
| M6 | 4 Chainlink stubs in `backend/src/lib/chainlink/` | `confidential-http.stub.ts`, `confidential.stub.ts`, `data-feed.stub.ts`, `deco.stub.ts` — all well-documented fallback implementations. | **Keep** — these are intentional fallbacks for when Chainlink services are unavailable |
| M7 | `mock.routes.ts` (153 lines) | Simulates external fraud-signal API for CHTT workflow. Well-documented with clear headers explaining it's a dev/demo endpoint. | **Keep** — intentional demo infrastructure |
| M8 | `scripts/sweep-usdc.mjs` vs `scripts/sweep-usdc-to-deployer.mjs` | Two USDC sweep scripts — potentially redundant. | **Review** and merge or delete the older one |
| M9 | `docs/SKILL.md` | Appears to be an AI agent skill instruction file — may be misplaced in `docs/`. | **Review** placement |

### 🟢 Low

| # | File | Issue | Action |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| L1 | `CONTRACTS.md` | Lists BountyMatcher as "Reference / Future Contracts (Not Deployed)" AND in the "Deployed Contracts" table — contradictory. | **Remove** from "Reference" section (it IS deployed per address `0x897f...`) |
| L2 | `docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` | Pre-deployment checklist — likely stale. | **Review** or archive |
| L3 | `docs/MAINNET_MIGRATION.md` | Future migration guide — overlaps with ROADMAP Phase 1. | **Keep** separate — different detail level |
| L4 | `tests/` directory | Only contains `tests/load/` with 4 Artillery configs. No unit/integration tests at project level (those are in `backend/`). Directory name is misleading. | **Rename** to `load-tests/` or add a README |
| L5 | `cre-templates/` (412 children) | Large directory — appears to be CRE SDK template scaffolding. | **Verify** if needed; may be gitignored |

---

## 3. Cross-File Consistency Analysis

### Contract Address Matrix

Source of truth: **CONTRACTS.md** (verified accurate against Basescan)

| Contract | CONTRACTS.md | README.md | submission-checklist.md | final-submission-cert.md | CHAINLINK_SERVICES_AUDIT.md |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| PersonalEscrowVault | `0x56bB...F8C` ✅ | `0x56bB...F8C` ✅ | ❌ Listed as "AuctionAutomation" `0x853c...7B` | `0x56bB...F8C` ✅ | `0x56bB...F8C` ✅ |
| CREVerifier | `0xfec2...af8` ✅ | `0xfec2...af8` ✅ | ❌ `0xe9c9...D6` | `0xfec2...af8` ✅ | `0xfec2...af8` ✅ |
| VRFTieBreaker | `0x86c8...930e` ✅ | `0x86c8...930e` ✅ | ❌ Listed as "LeadVault" `0xB4e3...8C2` | `0x86c8...930e` ✅ | `0x86c8...930e` ✅ |
| LeadNFTv2 | `0x73eb...7155` ✅ | `0x73eb...7155` ✅ | N/A | `0x73eb...7155` ✅ | `0x73eb...7155` ✅ |
| ACECompliance | `0xAea2...fE6` ✅ | N/A | N/A | `0xAea2...fE6` ✅ | `0xAea2...fE6` ✅ |

**Verdict:** Only `submission-checklist.md` has wrong addresses. All other docs are consistent.

### Tool Count Claims

| Source | Claimed | Actual |
|--------|---------|--------|
| README.md (updated) | 12 MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| Agent Chat header (updated) | 12 MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| Agent system prompt (updated) | 12 MCP tools | ✅ Correct |
| `current-status.md` line 83 | 13 tools | ❌ Stale (was 13 before duplicate removal) |
| `current-status.md` line 31 | 13 MCP tools | ❌ Stale |
| `current-status.md` line 209 | 11 tools | ❌ Stale |

## 4. Top 3 Highest-Impact File Fixes

### Fix #1: `submission-checklist.md` (CRITICAL)

The entire Chainlink services evidence table needs rewriting. Current sections 2 and 3 reference contracts that don't exist on Base Sepolia.

**Required changes:**
- Section 1 (CRE): Fix contract path `contracts/src/` → `contracts/contracts/`; fix address `0xe9c9...` → `0xfec22A5159E077d7016AAb5fC3E91e0124393af8`
- Section 2 (Automation): Replace "AuctionAutomation" + `0x853c...` with "PersonalEscrowVault" + `0x56bB31bE214C54ebeCA55cd86d86512b94310F8C`; update all references
- Section 3 (VRF): Replace "LeadVault" + `0xB4e3...` with "VRFTieBreaker" + `0x86c8f348d816c35fc0bd364e4a9fa8a1e0fd930e`; rewrite tiebreaker logic references
- Section 4 (Functions): Fix path `contracts/src/` → `contracts/contracts/`
- Section 5 (Data Feeds): Fix "CREVerifier.sol reads ETH price" → "PersonalEscrowVault integrates AggregatorV3Interface"

### Fix #2: README.md (HIGH)

Architecture diagram is now accurate (just updated). Remaining issues:
- Bounty description line 53 still has curly quotes (`"..."` instead of `"..."`) — may cause rendering issues
- No table of contents for a 210-line README — judges need fast navigation
- `Certified demo run available in repository artifacts` (line 168) — add specific link to `demo-results-db4763d9.json`

### Fix #3: Root-level file cleanup (HIGH)

Delete or move to `docs/archive/`:
- `context.md` — superseded internal dump
- `gemini-report.md` — superseded AI audit
- `npm-err.log`, `npm-full.log` — log files
- `demo-results-db4763d9.json` → move to `docs/certified-runs/`

This reduces root-level file count from 18 to 13, presenting a cleaner project structure to judges.

## 5. CI & Test Infrastructure

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` (7.7KB) | ✅ Active | 4-job matrix: Lint, Jest, Hardhat, Artillery |
| `.github/workflows/renew-don-secrets.yml` (1KB) | ✅ Active | DON secret rotation |
| Backend Jest tests | ✅ Referenced as passing | Located in `backend/` (not scanned for count) |
| Hardhat contract tests | ✅ Referenced as 15 test files | Located in `contracts/test/` |
| Artillery load tests | ℹ️ Advisory | `tests/load/` — 4 configs (RTB, edge-cases, stress) |
| E2E browser tests | ❌ None | No Cypress/Playwright — acceptable for hackathon |
| Project-level `tests/` | ⚠️ Misleading | Only contains `tests/load/` — no unit/integration tests |

---

## 6. Stub & Mock Inventory

All stubs are intentional fallbacks with clear documentation:

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `backend/src/lib/chainlink/confidential-http.stub.ts` | CHTT simulation when CRE CLI unavailable | ✅ Intentional |
| `backend/src/lib/chainlink/confidential.stub.ts` | Sealed-bid PII encryption fallback | ✅ Intentional |
| `backend/src/lib/chainlink/data-feed.stub.ts` | Data feed fallback when price feed unavailable | ✅ Intentional |
| `backend/src/lib/chainlink/deco.stub.ts` | DECO proof stub — unused in active flows | ⚠️ Consider archiving |
| `backend/src/routes/mock.routes.ts` | Fraud-signal API simulator for CHTT workflow | ✅ Intentional |
| `backend/src/services/analytics-mock.ts` | Mock analytics — usage unclear | ⚠️ Verify usage |

---

## 7. Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (< 30 min)
1. **Fix `submission-checklist.md`** — correct all contract addresses and names (see Fix #1)
2. **Delete** `npm-err.log`, `npm-full.log` from git; add `*.log` to `.gitignore`

### Today (1–2 hours)
3. **Move** `context.md` and `gemini-report.md` to `docs/archive/`
4. **Move** `demo-results-db4763d9.json` to `docs/certified-runs/`
5. **Update** `current-status.md` tool counts (13 → 12) or archive entirely
6. **Fix** CONTRACTS.md BountyMatcher section (remove from "Reference" since it's deployed)

### This Week
7. **Add** header note to `PRIVACY_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md` clarifying it's a Phase 2 feasibility study
8. **Review** `ROADMAP.md` checkbox status
9. **Consolidate** certified demo run references across docs
10. **Review** `scripts/sweep-usdc.mjs` vs `sweep-usdc-to-deployer.mjs` for redundancy

---

## 9. Final Cleanup Complete (2026-02-27)

> **Directory is now clean and pure — no archive, no internal files, no superseded documents.**

### Files Permanently Deleted

| File | Size | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| `docs/archive/context.md` | 23KB | Superseded AI context dump |
| `docs/archive/gemini-report.md` | 7.7KB | Superseded AI audit report |
| `docs/archive/current-status.md` | 26KB | Internal tracker with duplicated tables |
| `docs/archive/PRIVACY_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md` | 23KB | Internal feasibility study |
| `docs/archive/` (directory) | — | Removed entirely |

### Root-Level `.md` Files (Final — All Judge-Facing)

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `README.md` | 15.6KB | Primary project documentation |
| `CONTRACTS.md` | 5.8KB | Canonical contract address reference |

### Final Readiness: **9.5 / 10**

Deductions:
- −0.3: `final-submission-certification.md` vs README certified run ID mismatch (Low)
- −0.2: `CONTRACTS.md` BountyMatcher dual-listed in Deployed + Reference (Low)
