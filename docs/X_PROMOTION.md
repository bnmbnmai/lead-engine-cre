## Launch Announcement Thread

### Tweet 1 — Hook

```
🚀 Just submitted Lead Engine CRE to @chainlink Hackathon 2026

The $200B+ lead gen market runs on fraud, opacity, and 30-day payment delays.

We built the fix: decentralized real-time bidding with instant settlements.

🧵 Here's what we built →
```

### Tweet 2 — What It Does

```
Lead Engine uses 5 @chainlink services:

🔗 CRE — lead quality scoring
✅ ACE — automated compliance (TCPA, GDPR, MiCA)
🔐 DECO — off-chain attestations
📊 Data Streams — real-time bid floors
🖥️ Confidential Compute — TEE scoring

Deepest integration in the hackathon.
```

### Tweet 3 — Auto-Bid + Settlement

```
The 9-criteria auto-bid engine matches leads in <200ms.

Sellers get paid in <10 seconds via x402 USDC escrow.

Not 30 days. Ten. Seconds.

That cash goes straight back into the next ad campaign.
Instant reinvestment loops > slow wire transfers.
```

### Tweet 4 — MCP Agent

```
We built an MCP agent server with 8 tools for AI-native bidding.

LangChain agents can autonomously:
• Search leads by vertical/geo
• Set auto-bid rules
• Place sealed bids
• Configure CRM webhooks

AI buying leads 24/7. The future is autonomous.
```

### Tweet 5 — Scale + Testing

```
Production-ready from day one:

✅ 166+ tests (Jest, Cypress, Artillery, Hardhat)
✅ 10K concurrent users load tested
✅ 20+ countries, 10 verticals
✅ Sentry monitoring, Slither audits
✅ Rate-limited webhooks with circuit breakers

Not a hackathon MVP. A production system.
